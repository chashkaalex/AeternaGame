# AeternaGame
This is a web interface for a board game developed for the LiveRPG "Glistens of Aeterna".
It is aimed to depict and log the gameplay process accomplished IRL by the playing parties, but can actually be played unrelatedly in the hot-seat fation.

Everything is pure vanilla ES/html5/CSS, has no external libraries used, no requirements etc.

Any comments/suggestions are always welcome.
